# Railway-Reservation-System

### AIM: 

RAILWAY RESERVATION SYSTEM 
To develop the Railway Reservation System using Star UML tool 

### PROBLEM STATEMENT: 

1. An E-Ticket (Electronic ticket) is a paperless electronic document used for 
ticketing passengers, particularly in the commercil airline, railway industries. 
2.  An E-Ticket offers many advantages for both travelers and airline including 
security, flexibility and cost convenience. At the same time, it also provides the 
standard assurance of the traditional paper ticket, scaling choice, travel time 
options and other flexibilities 
3.  Passengers typically print out copies of their E-Ticket including confirmation E
mail and other document. All those documents can be replaced by pulling them 
out of the computer again and only a person with proper identification can 
actually use an E-Ticket 
4.  E-Ticket passengers can receive everything from gate assignments to 
cancellation or delay through E-mail, text messages sent to their home or 
business computers or to their cell phones 
5. Finally, using E-Ticket is a more environmental friendly approach. The main 
purpose of the online bus ticket system is to provide another way for 
transnational customers to buy their tickets 

### SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:

SQL 8.0 

### HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:

2.Pentium III Processor

# USECASE DIAGRAM:

A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify, 
and organize system requirements. The use case is made up of a set of possible 
sequences of interactions between systems and users in a particular environment and 
related to a particular goal. It is represented using ellipse. Actor is any external entity 
that makes use of the system being modeled.

# CLASS DIAGRAM:

A class is drawn as rectangle box with three compartments or components 
separated by horizontal lines. The top compartment holds the class name and middle 
compartment holds the attribute and bottom compartment holds list of operations.

# ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:

An activity diagram is a variation or special case of a state machine in which 
the states or activity representing the performance of operation and transitions are 
triggered by the completion of operation. The purpose is to provide view of close and 
what is going on inside a use case or among several classes. An activity is shown as 
rounded box containing the name of operation.

# SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:

A sequence diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a kind of 
interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what 
order.

# PACKAGE DIAGRAM:

A package diagram is represented as a folder shown as a large rectangle with a 
top attached to its upper left corner. A package may contain both sub ordinate package 
and ordinary model elements. All uml models and diagrams are organized into package. 
A package diagram in unified modeling language that depicts the dependencies 
between the packages that make up a model. A Package Diagram (PD) shows a grouping 
of elements in the OO model, and is a Cradle extension to UML PDs can be used to 
show groups of classes in Class Diagrams (CDs), groups of components or processes in 
Component Diagrams (CPDs), or groups of processors in Deployment Diagrams (DPDs). 
There are three types of layer. They are 
1.User interface layer 
2.Domain layer 
3.Technical services layer

# COMMUNICATION DIAGRAM:

A collaboration diagram is similar to sequence diagram but the message in 
number format. In a collaboration diagram sequence diagram is indicated by the 
numbering the message. A collaboration diagram, also called a communication 
diagram or interaction diagram, A sophisticated modeling tool can easily convert a 
collaboration diagram into a sequence diagram and the vice versa
